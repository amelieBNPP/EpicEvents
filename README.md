### Installation

1. Clone the project:

```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:amelieBNPP/epicevents.git
```
*Clone only one time the project.*

2. Active the virtual environement:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
*The virtual environement is created only one time, however, it is activate each time we start to develop.*

### Dependencies

Install dependencies :

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Install dependancies each time we develop on this project.*

### Run server

Server can be run using the following commands:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API can be tested in local at the following adresse : http://127.0.0.1:8000/

### Admin

Create a superUser in `manage.py` directory : 
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### FRONTEND

Django Administration will be used as a simple frontend : 
- launch server
- run : `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`
- connect with your supersUser identifiers

### Endpoints and filters

From postman, endpoints can be tested with the following routes : 

Create user with
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/signup/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/login/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/user/user/
```

create Employee with
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/employees/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/employees/?role=sales
```

create Client with
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/clients/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/clients/?sort_by=compagny_name
```

create Contract with
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/contracts/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/clients/<client pk>/contracts/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/clients/9/contracts/?min_amount=10000&max_amount=25000
```

create Event with
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/event/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/clients/<client pk>/contracts/<contract pk>/events/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/epicevents/clients/<client pk>/contracts/<contract pk>/events?min_attendees=100&max_attendees=200
```

All details are sumup in [postman documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14836417/UyrHdsws).
### Permissions

In the aim to improve security, permissions is set:
- manager GET/PUT/POST/DELETE client/employee/contract/event
- sales GET/PUT/POST/DELETE client/contract/event for which the sales is working, GET otherwise
- support GET/PUT/POST/DELETE event for which the sales is working, GET otherwise

### Test

Launch tests
To ensure new features do not add any regression in the code, run the tests with the following commands :
```bash
pytest
```
